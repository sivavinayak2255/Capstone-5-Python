### Python Capstone Project
As part of my Python capstone project, there were three different tables containing data related to employees, projects, and other business attributes. my task was to perform multiple data manipulation tasks using Pandas and NumPy to clean, process, and extract meaningful insights.
The project aimed to assess your ability to handle real-world data challenges by applying data cleaning, transformation, merging, and aggregation techniques.<br/><br/>
Reading and saving data as CSV files.
Handling missing values using a running average.
Splitting columns and restructuring data.
Merging multiple tables into a single dataframe.
Applying conditional transformations, such as calculating bonuses and modifying designations.
Filtering data based on specific criteria (e.g., city names containing 'o').
Computing aggregate values, such as total project cost per employee.<br/><br/>
Used Pandas to create three DataFrames and saved them as CSV files.
Applied a for loop to compute missing values in the cost column using a running average.
Split the name column into First Name and Last Name using str.split().
Merged all three tables into a single "Final" DataFrame using pd.merge().
Implemented a 5% bonus calculation for employees who completed their projects.<br/><br/>
Adjusted designation levels for failed projects and removed employees with level > 4.
Added “Mr.” and “Mrs.” prefixes to names based on gender and dropped the gender column.
Promoted employees older than 29 years by increasing their designation level by 1.
Computed the total cost of projects per employee and stored it in a new DataFrame (TotalProjCost).
Filtered employee details where city names contained the letter “o” using str.contains().<br/><br/>
Successfully completed all 10 data manipulation tasks using Pandas and NumPy.
Ensured accurate data processing, transformation, and aggregation.
Created clean, structured, and insightful data outputs.
Demonstrated proficiency in real-world data handling and analysis.
Strengthened skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, and DataFrame operations.<br/>
